This project is able to predict whether a heart attack will come or not .
Its has been implemented in python flask and web tools.
This takes some inputs to predict the output, hence users need to provide those inputs and then they can get their outputs as 1 if heart attacks may occur and 0 
if heart attack may not occur.
